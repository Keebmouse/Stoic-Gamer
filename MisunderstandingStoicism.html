                The definition of the word stoic often directly misrepresents the philosophy of Stoicism, and it is understandable that one would make that mistake. The words do share a commonality in some regards. The dictionary definition of stoic is one who is indifferent to pleasure or pain. This leads many to believe that Stoicism encourages people to cut off all emotion and avoid all pleasure. I’ve read several articles lately that talk about the failures of Stoicism. I’m not trying to claim that Stoicism is without its flaws. There is no perfect philosophy; if you think there is, you should reevaluate.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Stoicism does indeed seek to empower people to control their passions and temper their cravings, it does not deny those things. The Stoics were not Cynics. The Cynic school of philosophy taught that people give up material pleasure and desires. Their philosophy was about the simplicity of living your life with only what you truly needed.            </p>
            <p>
                The Stoics borrowed some of this mentality, to be sure. However, they weren’t above enjoying the good things in life if they happened upon them. Most people look at Stoicism and believe they were emotionless, monk-like figures who didn’t allow themselves to feel anything. Wouldn’t it be a sad and empty life if you were to turn away from every stimulus and trained yourself to feel nothing?            </p>
            <p>
                I define myself as a Stoic because of my experience with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). I suffer from severe mental illness. Without cognitive behavioral therapy, which has its roots in Stoicism, I would still be emotionally reactionary to every perceived failure and slight that I encountered. Learning to reframe my impressions using CBT, I can now slow down and honestly examine my thoughts before I react too passionately. This is all Stoicism truly aims to do.             </p>
            <p>
                The Stoics stressed that one should live in accordance with nature. Humans are social creatures, made to work in harmony and cooperate. They advocated that people live their lives with virtue and temperance. The passions that drive us toward the materials that we desire can cloud our judgments, negatively impact our actions, and, therefore, damage our virtue. There’s a quote from Epictetus that illustrates this.            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                “Remember that you must behave in life as at a banquet. Is anything brought around to you? Put out your hand and take your share with moderation. Does it pass by you? Don’t stop it. Is it not yet come? Don’t stretch out your desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you. Do this with regard to children, to a wife, to public posts, to riches, and you will eventually be a worthy partner of the feasts of the gods.”            </p>
            <p>
                Again, this quote does not call for you to shut off all desire for such things, only to see them as they are and accept that you might not be given the opportunity to enjoy them. The same goes for things like sex. Marcus Aurelius knew this all too well. He urges that people see pleasures for what they really are and not let them get in the way of living a virtuous life.            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                “When you have savories and fine dishes set before you, you will gain an idea of their nature if you tell yourself that this is the corpse of a fish, and that the corpse of a bird or a pig; or again, that this Falernian wine is merely the juice of a grape-cluster, and this purple-edged robe is sheep’s wool dyed with the gore of a shellfish; and as for sexual intercourse, it is the friction of a piece of gut and, following a sort of convulsion, the expulsion of some mucus. Thoughts like these go to the heart of actual facts and penetrate them, so as to see the kind of things they really are.” - Marcus Aurelius           </p>
            <p>
                That last bit about sex may make it seem like Marcus Aurelius was utterly uninterested in a healthy sex life. On the contrary, Marcus Aurelius had at least 13 children. He was no stranger to sexual intercourse. After his wife died, he took a concubine as well. We can enjoy all of these things and let our passion for life help us build amazing inventions and develop strong relationships. We can do all these things while maintaining objectivity and disciplining our minds to execute our duties to the highest standards of excellence.            </p>
            <p>
                Stoicism is not a sterile, emotionless, passionless philosophy. It emphasizes personal discipline and executing duties to one's maximum potential. Marcus Aurelius wasn’t passionless. He struggled with anger constantly, but he never let it impact his execution of his duty. That is Stoicism. You can still feel all of the passions that spring to life inside you. Through Stoicism, you can examine those passions and act more rationally. You don’t have control over what happens to you in life, but if you discipline your mind, you will not let these things cause you to react poorly. Instead, you can look at these events for what they really are and deal with them appropriately. That is Stoicism. That is the philosophy of a strong discipline of the mind. It is one of understanding passion, not forsaking it.            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                “You control your thoughts, not outside events. Realize this and you’ll find strength.” – Marcus Aurelius
