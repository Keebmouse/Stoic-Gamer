                We’ve all been there- stuck in a rut. You feel like you’re going nowhere with something you're working your hardest on. I’m there right now. I’m trying to live in Canada with my partner, and I don’t have a work permit. I’m toiling every day to create something online that can generate income to pay the rent. It can be overwhelming to be under the gun and running out of time. You can’t let those stressors rob you of your priorities. To be successful at anything online, you need to be consistent.             </p>
            <p>
                Maybe it’s not money or a project you’re working on. Perhaps you’re struggling with mental health or addiction. As someone who has struggled with both, I can tell you that the only way I was able to overcome them was through consistency. You don’t have to go through what I went through to learn how to overcome them. I spent two months in a psychiatric facility. I had no choice but to follow through with all of the staff’s instructions and guidance. This showed me that I can’t just skip meds because I’m too depressed, and I just want to distract myself with more drugs or video games. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of drugs, when it comes to addiction, you have to accept where you are in your current situation. Most 12-step programs advise that you must look to a higher power for guidance and support. I suggest that you have that higher power within you. If you do believe in God, it certainly makes things easier, but it shouldn’t be a requirement.  You have the power to say no. One of the hardest things I've ever had to do was quit smoking. It was tough and took me many years. The problem is that when I got overwhelmed, cigarettes were my coping device for dealing with stress. I had my family to support me during those times.             </p>
            <p>
                For that situation, I would do the math. The average cost of a pack of cigarettes in the United States is $ 9.74 per pack. Let’s round it up to $10 a day. What does that cost you in a month of smoking? You’re looking at over $300 in most cases. That’s a lot of money. One of the most significant stressors in our society is financial concerns. I took that money and used it to buy nicotine patches. Remember, as with anything, consistency is the key. It takes several weeks with the highest dose of nicotine patch before you’re advised to start tapering off.             </p>
            <p>
                This is because other underlying factors cause addiction. There are things like oral fixation and the ritual of smoking a cigarette that you have to let go of. You have to give yourself time. It will feel like it isn’t working for the first two to three weeks of treatment. The only way you can make it is if you don’t give in and keep your promise to yourself, using the patches every day. Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances on the planet. It won't be easy, but I promise you that if you maintain your self-discipline, you will be able to overcome it. I quit in 2018 and haven’t had a cigarette since.            </p>
            <p>
                The primary focus of this blog is the intersection of philosophy and video games. Let’s tie both of those together to finish out this article. Gaming can be an addiction. This is especially true if the game is designed to keep you hooked on the mechanics, allowing you to progress through it. There are things like loot box style rewards, and item drop chances that can leave you fiending to run that dungeon one more time. Just one more, over and over, until all of a sudden it's 5 AM and you need to get ready for work with no sleep.            </p>
            <p>
                Acquiring games can be addictive, too. I was hooked on the Nintendo Switch. I have over 60 physical games. I sold my consoles a long time ago because I finally recognized it for what it is: addiction. Do I regret it? Of course I do. But that’s the addiction talking, and I’m better off without something that destroyed my chances of staying in Canada long term. I spent over $ 3500 acquiring these games, and most of them I didn’t even play.             </p>
            <p>
                You need to invest in yourself. Like any investment, patience and consistency are key. If you’re suffering from addiction or mental health issues, the first place to start is maintaining proper self-care and a diet, along with consistent medication. The reason many people fail to do this is that they are not patient enough and lapse on consistency. I’ll leave you with one quote. It is one of my favorites and has a distinctly Stoic flavor, which is why I love it.             </p>
